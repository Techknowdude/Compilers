# Compilers
This project is a compiler for a subset of the C language. The output is in C, but the output can easily be changed to any language by changing the implementation of the generate code interface of the AstNode base class.

This project was done in the Winter of 2015 at Oregon Institute of Technology for the Compilers class.

Bison and Flex are used for the parser and compiler framework.
