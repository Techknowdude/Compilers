Lab3 Feedback

LATE

Your feedback file should have the feedback from the previous labs.

Git did not find the tag you gave me in the email, so I just pulled the most recent commit.

Your build has warnings.

Symbol::GetSequence() will probably never be used.

I would consider using Symbol::SetSequence an error. The sequence number should be fixed by the constructor and immutable from there on.

Instead of 
(*SymbolHashes.front()).setHash(AsciiHash);
I would use
SymbolHashes.front()->setHash(AsciiHash);
This form occurs multiple places in your code.

Since you're using the STL for some of your underlying hash table functionality, you should have simply used unordered_map to do the whole thing.

Lab 4 Feedback

Even though your initial submission was on time, your git history indicates you worked past the deadline. I won't give you the 50% penalty, but I will take away your 10% bonus for working individually.

-5 Your git repository has intermediate files. It should only have source.

-5 A function definition should have the same symbols for parameters as a previous declaration.

It isn't clear why IfStmt inherits from ExprNode. There is no where in the gramar where an IF can be an EXPR.

I prefer indenting declarations relative to public:, protected:, or private:. I think it makes the code easier to read. It looks like some places you did, others you didn't.

-10 Your code is not properly documented.

Lab 5 feedback

-5 It appears like you do not increase scope for a function prefix. This makes it appear like parameters are defined in the outer scope. func_prefix is a separate rule in the grammar specifically to allow you to increase scope at this point. This error is at least part of why you did not pass test0.

It appears like you were working off an old version of the lab. I updated some of the error messages and you were generating the old version. I did not take off points for this.

It is not clear to me why ExprNode is a subclass of ParamNode. ParamNode does not seem to add any functionality. You could have simple had a param defined as an expr in lang.y and eliminated ParamNode.

Late: -20%

Lab 6 feedback

I received a strange error when trying to pull that lab6 tag. I pulled the most recent commit and graded that.

-20 It appears that you do not ComputeOffsets on the conditional expressions nor the statements in ifs and whiles.

Lab 7 Feedback

-10 When calling a function, you do not set the Frame Pointer to the correct place. You need:
Frame_Pointer = Stack_Pointer - <size of params>;
