Lab3 Feedback

LATE

Your feedback file should have the feedback from the previous labs.

Git did not find the tag you gave me in the email, so I just pulled the most recent commit.

Your build has warnings.

Symbol::GetSequence() will probably never be used.

I would consider using Symbol::SetSequence an error. The sequence number should be fixed by the constructor and immutable from there on.

Instead of 
(*SymbolHashes.front()).setHash(AsciiHash);
I would use
SymbolHashes.front()->setHash(AsciiHash);
This form occurs multiple places in your code.

Since you're using the STL for some of your underlying hash table functionality, you should have simply used unordered_map to do the whole thing.
