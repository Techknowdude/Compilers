Lab3 Feedback

LATE

Your feedback file should have the feedback from the previous labs.

Git did not find the tag you gave me in the email, so I just pulled the most recent commit.

Your build has warnings.

Symbol::GetSequence() will probably never be used.

I would consider using Symbol::SetSequence an error. The sequence number should be fixed by the constructor and immutable from there on.

Instead of 
(*SymbolHashes.front()).setHash(AsciiHash);
I would use
SymbolHashes.front()->setHash(AsciiHash);
This form occurs multiple places in your code.

Since you're using the STL for some of your underlying hash table functionality, you should have simply used unordered_map to do the whole thing.

Lab 4 Feedback

Even though your initial submission was on time, your git history indicates you worked past the deadline. I won't give you the 50% penalty, but I will take away your 10% bonus for working individually.

-5 Your git repository has intermediate files. It should only have source.

-5 A function definition should have the same symbols for parameters as a previous declaration.

It isn't clear why IfStmt inherits from ExprNode. There is no where in the gramar where an IF can be an EXPR.

I prefer indenting declarations relative to public:, protected:, or private:. I think it makes the code easier to read. It looks like some places you did, others you didn't.

-10 Your code is not properly documented.
